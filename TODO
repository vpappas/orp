TODO items:

* go through the function analysis/classification in func.py

* relax some restrictions in reorder.py which don't allow some
  instructions to be rordered (like call, etc.)

* move swap related code from insn.py to swap.py (e.g. the
  swap_registers function)

* shrink the size of the ida dump files by only keeping the
  minimal information (should be just the CFG..)

* try to enable safe randomizations like equiv in parts of the
  code that IDA has recognized but was not able to construct
  the CFG (red areas)

* investigate more functions that end with a jump (instead of ret)

* add support for combining overlapping register swaps

* add support for ELF binaries

* add a toy ROP payload for testlib.dll for testing/demonstration
  purposes

* improve logging (maybe switch from print to the logging module)

* add support for disassemblers other than IDA Pro
